Switzerland is a global leader in e-waste management. In 2022, the country recycled 85% of its e-waste, far exceeding the EU target of 65%. <br/>

How did Switzerland achieve this success?<br/>

There are a number of factors that contribute to Switzerland's success in e-waste management. These include: <br/>

Strong government policies: Switzerland has a comprehensive e-waste management law that sets clear requirements for producers, retailers, and consumers. The law requires producers to take back and recycle their products, and it provides financial incentives for recycling. <br/>

The ORDEE law provides financial incentives for recycling. Producers who recycle their products are exempt from paying a waste disposal fee. This fee is used to fund the collection and recycling of e-waste. <br/>

Private sector intervention: The Swiss government works closely with the private sector to implement its e-waste management policies. There are a number of private companies that are involved in the collection, recycling, and disposal of e-waste. <br/>

The Swiss e-waste management system is a public-private partnership. The government sets the rules and regulations, and the private sector is responsible for implementing them. This partnership has been very successful in achieving high recycling rates. <br/>

Consumer awareness: Swiss consumers are generally aware of the importance of e-waste recycling. They are also willing to pay a small fee to ensure that their e-waste is recycled properly. <br/>
The Swiss government has conducted a number of public awareness campaigns to educate consumers about the importance of e-waste recycling. These campaigns have been very successful in raising awareness of the issue. <br/>

Use of technology: Switzerland uses a variety of technologies to improve its e-waste management system. For example, the country uses a barcode tracking system to track e-waste from the point of sale to the recycling facility. <br/>
This system allows the government to track the amount of e-waste that is being recycled and to identify any areas where recycling rates are low. <br/>
Logistical efficiency: Switzerland has a well-developed logistics network that makes it easy to collect and recycle e-waste. The country also has a number of dedicated e-waste collection points. <br/>

They also have a well-developed logistics network that makes it easy to collect and recycle e-waste. This network includes a number of dedicated e-waste collection points, as well as a network of collection bins that are located at recycling centers and other public places. <br/>

Conclusion <br/>
Switzerland's e-waste management system is a model for other countries. <br/>
We can learn from Switzerland's success by implementing strong government policies, working with the private sector, raising consumer awareness, using technology, and improving logistical efficiency. <br/>
